This is uses Sockets where it communicates with multiple clients using threads and conditional variables.
I have created Multiple client networked spell checker which does a simple spell check from different clients and writes it to the log file.
It uses synchronization so there is no race condition occurring  in my project. I have created three threads. 
so once there are three clients connected to my sever. It will not allow any more clients to be connected. 
for example if we do create a fourth client and the user does type in some words the client will not be connected to the server 
until the one of the client has disconnected. 
There are two thread function which runs forever because the server shouldn't quit until the user enters ^c. 
To end the client the user can enter ^ or just simply close the client. 

To run the Program:
Server Side
1. open a Terminal and enter "make"
2. ./network PORTNO(Optional, Default 9000)  NAMEOFDICTIONARY(Optional, default "dictionary.txt")

Client Side
1. open another Terminal
2. enter telnet localhost PORTNO(same as the server PORTNO)
3. Enter your input
