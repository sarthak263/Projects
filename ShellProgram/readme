Multiple Commands exits in Linux System Some simple Builtin commands that my Shell implements.

cd -> changes directory ex. cd directory
quit -> quits my program
help -> print helping manual
echo -> prints the output on the system
dir -> prints out all the files in the directory
clr -> which clears the screen


Also my shell can handles pips which connects two process togtheres to get the output for example ls | more


IO redirection in when it can add or create to the files like echo helloworld > temp. creates a temp file which has hello world in it
and <  echo < temp reads from the file.

My shell can also implement any linux commands like ls which is just like dir. so it can support both dir and ls and have the same result from it.
