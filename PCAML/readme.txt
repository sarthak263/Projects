Part2:

	Run part2.py and it will show the Projection Data.
	I have also saved Part2Image.docx file and should be in the same directory.
	
Part3:

	run part3.py
	

REDO:

	I changed Part1 and part2 graph and Part3 for the redo project. Part3 does everything step by step however the video is still not correct i wonder
	why it may be that way. Since I did exactly the same thing as part 2.
