# codesignal-reverseoddcount
Reverse the order of all characters in a string that occur an odd amount of times (spaces included). All other characters should remain in the same position; only odd-frequency characters are eligible to swap with each other.
Case-sensitivity is important, so for example "a" is considered different than "A" when counting character frequencies.
Example
For str = "hello world", the output should be reverseOddCount(str) = "dlrwo loleh".

Occurrences:
h: 1 (reverse because it occurs an odd # of times)

e: 1 (reverse because it occurs an odd # of times)

l: 3 (reverse because it occurs an odd # of times)

o: 2 (leave it in place because it occurs an even # of times)

w: 1 (reverse because it occurs an odd # of times)

r: 1 (reverse because it occurs an odd # of times)

d: 1 (reverse because it occurs an odd # of times)
