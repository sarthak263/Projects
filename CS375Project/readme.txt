Dependencies/assumptions:
This project assumes the mySQL database is already running in the background and there exists a database called "cs375_final" and a table named "users".

Open a command prompt to the source code directory and start the node.js server by entering the command:
node Server.js

This will start the server, listening on port 8080

To start the app, go to localhost:8080/login.html
Log in with valid credentials and it will go to the main.html page where all the exercises and description are.
